# sustag_orctrl

We introduce SUSTag-ORCtrL that uses raw ionic current signatures of DNA tags for demultiplexing into 96 or 384 classes. Our system, involving a Bhattacharyya distance and incremental clustering enhanced molecular tag design (SUSTag), an optional-reject CNN-LSTM deep learning model, and a transfer-learning pipeline (ORCtrL), minimizes crosstalk for random access.
